source of ALA omega-3 (Contains 0.5 g of ALA omega-3 per serving, which is 31% of the recommended daily value of 1.6 g). 3 generations. USDA organic. Per 55 g serving: 9 g fiber; 9 g protein; 15 g whole grain. Non GMO Project verified. This product is sold by weight, not by volume. You can be assured of proper weight even though some settling of contents normally occurs during shipment and handling. To maintain freshness, store in a cool, dry place. We're so happy our paths have crossed. Was it the tasty whole grain flakes and crunchy fiber twigs that led you here? Maybe you were looking to kick it up a notch when you came upon this high fiber cereal sprinkled with cinnamon and blueberries. Or, did you just want Optimum Power without having to wear a cape and tights? Whatever your reason for winding up on Nature's Path, we're glad you did. And if you want to find more foods that are good for you, your family and the planet, here are the signs to look for. Certified organic. Unlike natural label claims, certified organic products are guaranteed to have been grown without chemical herbicides and pesticides, and there are never synthetic preservatives or additives. Because, really, who wants any of that for breakfast? Non-GMO. GMO stands for genetically modified organisms. Doesn't sound too tasty, does it? The Non-GMO Project agrees, and their verification assures you that the food you're buying is made in a kitchen - not in a lab. Whole grains. Foods made from whole grains have all the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the entire grain seed, and the Whole Grain Stamp tells you how much you get per serving. High fiber. Whole grains. Certified organic. Growing up on an organic farm, I learned a lot about caring for the land and the importance of good stewardship. As my father Rupert used to say, always leave the Earth better than you found it. Those wise words flavor everything we do here at Nature's Path. Being a family-run, independent company, we've had the freedom to place people first and get behind the things we're passionate about. Things like tracking down exotic new ingredients and super foods, supporting family & organic farming, championing wildlife conservation and showing leadership in support of food banks and urban gardens. Things that matter, to us - and to you. Arran Stephens. Founder & garden-keeper. EnviroBox. Less package. More sustainable. We're committed to being as sustainable as possible, which is why we are always trying to make our packaging as small as we can. That said, you may have noticed this box is a bit smaller than it used to be - with the same amount of cereal. Excellent source of ALA omega-3. High fiber. Whole grain. Vegan.

USDA organic. High fiber. Nurturing people, nature & spirit. Low fat. Ask a dietitian, one in a series on the backs of our boxes. Good fats, bad fats, and your health. Dietary fats have gotten a bad rap for some time, but the truth of the matter is that we humans not only like the taste of fat, we also need it - to store energy, to help digest some vitamins and phytonutrients, and to contribute to hormone synthesis. The problem with fat: But as useful as fat may be to your body, many clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that diets high in cholesterol and saturated fats are associated with a higher risk of heart disease and some cancers. Good guys vs. bad guys: Equally true, recent clinical studies have shown that some fats are bad for your health while others can actually be good for you. Dietary fat is essentially made of three kinds of triglycerides: saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Research has demonstrated that limiting saturated fat and increasing monounsaturated fats can be beneficial - hence the description good fat. Omega-3 and omega-6 are two kinds of polyunsaturates that, if consumed in the right ratio, appear to be health promoting. Specifically, animal and human studies have linked them with improved cardiovascular health. Omega-3 is notably associated with reducing inflammation, discouraging blood clotting, and expanding blood vessels. How much is enough?: Nutritional guidelines recommend no more than 30% of your calories come from fats. For a typical 2,000 calorie diet, that translates to 65 grams of fat. Your challenge is to make sure most of these are monounsaturated or polyunsaturated good fats. 10% or less of your total calories should be from bad or saturated fats. That's a maximum of 20 grams per day. Considering that one cup of a premium ice cream can whomp you with 23 grams of saturated fat, you have your work cut out for you! - by Tamara Schryver, MS RD. Sources of Omega Fats: Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), are found in canola oil, wheat germ, soybeans, hempseeds, and flaxseeds. Flaxseeds are the richest plant source of ALA. About 41% of the seed is oil, of which 57% is omega-3 and 16% omega-6. As a bonus, flaxseeds include other healthful compounds. 20% of the seed is protein and 28% is dietary fiber. The seed is a good source of lignans, too, and high in minerals and vitamins. Our values: We make organic foods because we believe organic farming and production techniques are better for the environment. Like other enterprises, return on investment, financial viability, waste-reduction, and brand leadership are all important goals. But at Nature's Path these conventional business values are overlaid with the notion that none of it amounts to a hill of beans if we don't choose sustainable, environmentally responsible processes that will leave the world better than we found it. In short, we're about making wholesome, delicious food in a way that will benefit our planet, our employees, and you, our customer. What's good about Flax Plus Cereal? Each 30 g serving has 7 g of fiber, making FlaxPlus a high fiber source. Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. What's good about certified organic goodness? Good food. No synthetic pesticides. No synthetic herbicides. No preservatives or additives. No genetically engineered seeds or ingredients. No irradiation. Good ecology. Enriched, drought resistant soil. Less soil erosion. Less groundwater pollution. Improved farm biodiversity. O health! Oh health! The blessings of the rich!

We are known worldwide as the pioneer maker of traditional Swiss Muesli but few know of our early role in supporting natural farming techniques that respect the environment. Since 1958 Bio-Familia has been using organically grown cereals and fruits in its products. A close relationship with the pioneer of organic cultivation in Switzerland, Dr. Hans Muller, made Bio-Familia one of the first companies to discover the benefit of growing grains that replenish and maintain healthy soil while eliminating toxic chemicals. Thanks to this experience and know how, Bio-Familia manufactures naturally grown cereal products that deliver outstanding taste and quality. Familia is proud to continue our tradition of wholesome cereals by bringing you unique cereals grown in balance with the land. For 100% of nature's best in every bowl.

Friend of the heart. Originally developed in the late 1800's by a Swiss nutritionist, Muesli is a delightful cereal made from a blend of whole grains, dried fruit, nuts and seeds. Bob's Red Mill is dedicated to providing a highly nutritious whole grain cereal that's very tasty, so we've combined whole grain rolled oats, wheat, rye, triticale and barley, along with sweet and chewy dates and raisins, sunflower seeds, almonds and walnuts for a high energy Muesli you're sure to love. Try our Old Country Style Muesli hot, cold or right out of the bag. Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods low in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers. All natural.","directions":"For a delicious and satisfying cold snack, lunch or meal, soak 1/4 cup Bob's Red Mill Old Country Muesli in 1/2 cup yogurt for 5 to 10 minutes (or overnight like the Swiss do) and enjoy! Also, try it in fruit juice or milk. Makes 1 serving. For a wonderful different hot cereal, add 1/2 cup Muesli to 1/2 cup water or milk and bring to a boil; simmer 3 to 5 minutes. You an also microwave, covered in a large bowl on high for 3 to 5 minutes. Makes 2 servings.

Low sodium. Nurturing people, nature & spirit. USDA Organic. Excellent source whole grain. We've come a long way. Now it's easier to eat well! Our Millet Rice with Oatbran cereal embodies a tradition passed to us from several ancient civilizations. The nutritional benefits of whole grain millet, brown rice and oats have sustained and continues to sustain millions of people. It's been our mandate all along to blend and create from these heirloom grains great tasting, healthful organic foods - in the process it has helped support agricultural diversity. Arran Stephens, founder of Nature's Path, realized long ago that you could enjoy delicious food and still help save the earth. Millet: From Africa to China by way of India: Millet goes way back. Pearl Millet, the most common variety, originated in West Africa, while other varieties made their way to India 3,000 years ago. In 4,500 BC China, Millet was considered a Sacred Crop, and it became a staple in Europe during the Middle Ages before the introduction of potatoes and corn. Millet's popularity through the ages may have something to do with its drought-resistance and its ability to grow in nearly any soil, making it an important crop all over Africa, India and parts of North America today. But you'll likely enjoy Millet for its Magnesium as well as its niacin, thiamin & phyto-nutrients that may lower cholesterol. You might also enjoy it just for its nutty, toasty good flavor. Rice: From Traditional Medicine to Modern Nutrition: Recent evidence suggests, Rice was first cultivated in Asia over 9,000 years ago, and its nutritional benefits have long been appreciated. Ancient Chinese medicinal texts prescribed eating just brown rice for 10 days as the first step towards healing, and it was considered a vital and harmonious food. We now better understand its benefits, especially that of Brown Rice - Rice that has not been milled beyond the removal of its outer husk, retaining its bran, germ and other healthful portions. Brown Rice contains Manganese (good for energy and antioxidants), as well as for selenium, magnesium and fiber. When you put it all together, Millet Rice is a cereal with a unique, crunchy flavor you'll come to love. 3 Generations of commitment to organic farming. What's good about your Millet Rice Cereal? Millet Rice with Oatbran is a fruit juice sweetened whole grain cereal. Millet contains Magnesium, while brown rice contains manganese & fiber. What's good about certified organic goodness?
