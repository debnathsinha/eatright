Large Bread Machine (2 lb capacity): Set machine on gluten free setting (follow manufacturer's direction for gluten-free setting). Short cycle and programmable features may be used. Follow manufacturers instructions for order of adding yeast, wet and dry ingredients. Press start. During first kneading cycle, open lid and use rubber spatula and help mix dough. If dough appears dry and crumbly, add warm water, 1 tbsp at a time, mixing after each addition, until dough is smooth and throughly moistened.
