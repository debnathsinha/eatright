to Use this Product: You can replace regular flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour in your recipes 1:1. We recommend that you add xanthan gum for best results when substituting Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour (see chart below). Yeasted breads are a little more difficult and may require eggs, vinegar and possibly more liquid to be added to the recipe. Quantity of Xanthan Gum: 1/4 tsp for cookies; 1/2 tsp for cakes; 3/4 tsp for muffins and quick breads; 1 to 1-1/2 tsp for breads 2 tsp for pizza crusts. Use the quantities suggested of xanthan gum per cup of flour used. For example, if you are making cookies with 3 cups of flour, you would add 3/4 tsp of xanthan gum.","warnings":"Manufactured in a facility that also uses tree nuts and soy.","ingredients":"Garbanzo Bean Flour, Potato Starch, Tapioca Flour, White Sorghum Flour, Fava Bean Flour.","organic":false,"kosher":false,"gluten_free":true,"low_fat":false,"fat_free":false,"sugar_free":false,"vegan":false,"vegetarian":false,"serving_size":"0.25 cup","servings_per_container":"18","calories":100,"fat_calories":5,"fat":1.0,"saturated_fat":0.0,"trans_fat":0.0,"polyunsaturated_fat":null,"monounsaturated_fat":null,"cholesterol":0,"sodium":0,"potassium":null,"carbohydrate":22,"fiber":3,"sugars":1,"protein":3,"alcohol_by_volume":null},{"id":4072072,"available":true,"unlisted":false,"aisle_id":4269,"sale_percent":null,"department_id":84,"brand_name":"Bob's Red Mill","name":"Baking Ingredients Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch","display_name":"Bob's Red Mill Potato Starch","price":4.39,"full_price":null,"sale_price":null,"price_per_unit":4.39,"loyalty_price":null,"loyalty_price_active":false,"size":"24 oz","display_size":"24 oz","product_type":"normal","unit":"each","par_weight":null,"related_item_ids":[],"visible":true,"warehouse_id":3,"primary_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/primary_aaecf03f-82c3-44d0-a214-13cecf45598e.jpg","large_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/large_aaecf03f-82c3-44d0-a214-13cecf45598e.jpg","frequently_not_found":null,"frequently_found":null,"often_out_of_stock":null,"special_instructions":null,"featured":false,"user_description":null,"unit_count":null,"bulky":false,"taxable":false,"is_alcoholic?":false,"impulse_buy":null,"wine_rating":null,"product_id":49744,"aisle_ids":[4269],"department_ids":[84],"aisle_sort_order":48,"aisle_sort_orders":{"4269":48},"dept_sort_order":236,"dept_sort_orders":{"84":236},"details":"","directions":"Keeps best refrigerated or frozen.

Supplement. Cold milled. Ready to use! Omega-3 & lignans. 98 mg lignans per serving. Great nutty taste. 4 g dietary fiber. Rich in essential fatty acids. USDA organic. 2.7 g omega-3 per serving. The taste of goodness. What is good taste? For most people taste is simply a matter of flavor. We believe that the taste of goodness is about making conscious and thoughtful decisions about the foods we eat, the planet we share and the people we work with every day. The Benefits of Flaxseed: Flaxseed offers the benefits of fiber, ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), protein and SDG lignans. Fiber promotes regularity, supports normal functioning of the digestive tract and can have a positive effect on cholesterol. ALA is an omega-3 essential fatty acid that supports heart health and helps to maintain beautiful hair, skin and nails. SDG lignans are phytonutrients that exhibit antioxidant properties and can have a balancing effect on hormones. Not All Flaxseeds Are Created Equal: Spectrum Flaxseeds are premium quality organic seeds that have been carefully selected for their nutritive content. Flaxseed is the most concentrated source of SDG lignans - which can vary from 0.7%-1.9% of seed weight depending on seasonal variations and growing conditions. These select seeds are meticulously cleaned using a three-part process to remove low weight, broken, and dirty seeds commonly found in bulk bins. Only Spectrum uses a proprietary milling process that finely slices the seed, rather than crushing it, thereby preventing the loss of valuable nutrients from oxidation. The sliced seed is immediately packaged in this light-protective pouch and then flushed with an inert gas and airtight sealed to ensure optimum health benefits and product freshness. No preservatives. Certified organic by QAI. (These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.) Product of USA or Canada.","directions":"2-3 tbsp daily.

best refrigerated or frozen. Tips for Using Coconut Flour: You can replace up to 20% of the flour called for in a recipe with Coconut Flour, adding an equivalent amount of additional liquid to the recipe. If batter seems too thick, thin out by adding a bit more oil until desired consistency is achieved. If batter seems too runny, don't worry. Coconut Flour's high fiber content makes it very absorbent. During baking, the coconut will absorb much of the liquid. To maintain freshness, store Coconut Flour in an airtight container after opening package.","warnings":"Manufactured in a facility that also uses tree nuts and soy.","ingredients":"Organic

Pouch Contains: Pizza crust mix + yeast packet. You Will Need: 1 cup (250 ml) warm water (95 degrees F/35 degrees C) + 1 whole egg + olive oil. Yield: Two 12-inch pizza crusts, 6-8 slices each. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. If using pizza stone, place on bottom rack of oven. 1. Mix together Cup4Cup Pizza Crust Mix and yeast in a large bowl. Add water and egg to the dry ingredients. Using a fork, stir until the dough is shaggy, then knead using your hands until dough is a uniform consistency. 2. Divide dough in half and roll each into a ball. Wrap one dough ball in plastic wrap and set aside until ready to repeat steps 3 through 8 (uncooked dough is best stored in the refrigerator and used within 24 hours). Place the other dough ball onto a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat. 3. Roll the dough into a 14-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick without using any additional dry ingredients for dusting. Fold down 1 inch of the circle's outer edge all around to create a ridge, pinching well to seal. 4. Pour 1-1/2 tablespoons of olive oil onto a half sheet pan. Transfer the round to the oiled pan. Spread 1 tablespoon of olive oil evenly on top of the dough. Prick all over with a fork. 5. Prebake in the oven for 8-10 minutes until crust is light golden brown. Remove from oven. 6. Top the cooked crust with your favorite toppings. 7. Transfer pizza onto the heated pizza stone or bake directly on a rack in the top half of the oven. Cook until toppings are melted and bubbling. 8.

Guittard Chocolate Company was founded in San Francisco in 1868 by Etienne Guittard. Four generations later, the company remains family-owned and operated, and is one of the few bean-to-bar chocolate makers remaining in the United States. Guittard continues the family tradition of custom-making superior quality chocolate for professional pastry chefs, artisan confectioners and gourmet ice cream makers. More recently, with the introduction of E. Guittard chocolates in specialty food retail stores, home chefs can now use these same chocolates - chocolates that top professional pastry chefs have relied on up for over a century. This blend starts with a warm, fragrant chocolate flavor, develops into rice cherry and complex raisin notes and ends with a refreshing chocolate finish that lasts and lasts. It is extremely popular with pastry chefs due to its versatility and perfection as a backdrop for other ingredients, such as nuts, dried fruits and even strong, tropical fruit flavors such as coconut and banana.","directions":null,"warnings":"Artisanally crafted in traditional grinding mills that also make milk chocolate.","ingredients":"Cacao Beans, Pure Can Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Soya Lecithin,
