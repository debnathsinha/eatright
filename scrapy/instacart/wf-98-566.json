Growing up on an organic farm, I learned a lot about caring for the land and the importance of good stewardship. As my father Rupert used to say, Always leave the Earth better than you found it. Those wise words flavor everything we do here at Nature's Path. Being a family-run, independent company, we've had the freedom to place people first and get behind the things we're passionate about. Things like tracking down exotic new ingredients and superfoods, supporting family & organic farming, championing wildlife conservation and showing leadership in support of food banks and urban gardens. Things that matter, to us - and to you - Arran Stephens - founder & garden-keeper. EnviroBox - less package. More sustainable. We're committed to being as sustainable as possible, which is why we are always trying to make our packaging as small as we can. That said, you may have noticed this box is a bit smaller than it used to be - with the same amount of cereal. We're so happy our paths have crossed. Was it the crunchy clusters of whole-grain rolled oats with a tasty touch of cinnamons & raisins that led you here? Maybe you were looking for a delicious high fiber cereal, packed with psyllium and raisins, when you came upon this hearty granola. Or were you just looking for a healthier alternative to cinnamon buns? Whatever your reason for joining us on Nature's Path, we're glad you're here. And if you want to find more foods that are good for you, your family and the planet, here are the signs to look for. Certified organic. Unlike natural label claims, certified organic products are guaranteed to have been grown without chemical herbicides and pesticides, and there are never synthetic preservatives or additives. Because, really, who wants any of that for breakfast? Non GMO. GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organisms. Doesn't sound too tasty, does it? The Non GMO Project agrees, and their verification assures you that the food you're buying is made in a kitchen - not in a lab. Whole grains. Foods made from whole grains have all the essential parts and naturally occurring nutrients of the entire grain seed, and the Whole Grain Stamp tells you how much you get per serving. Let us know how your journey's going, how we can make it better, or maybe even what you think of our look. www.naturespath.com. facebook.com/naturespath.
