In 1988, our founder Nancy Silverton combined flour and water with organic grapes. These ancient ingredients and their wild yeasts were the beginning of our signature sourdough starter. From it we created our whole wheat and rye starters. These three starters are the foundation of virtually all of the breads we make. Although the elements are basic, producing our bread is not simple. As they are alive, our breads require a daily response to environmental changes and constant fine tuning of our bread making techniques. When you try our breads you will taste the quality and flavors that only this kind of passionate attention to detail can assure. French Loaf: We use a softer flour to create the thinner crust and softer texture of the traditional breads of France. Unlike our award winning sourdough, this version has a traditional French flavor, tasting buttery, wheaty and faintly sweet.","directions":"Our breads taste best on the day of purchase, although they will keep longer. Remember, the larger the loaf, the longer it will keep. Keep the bread at room temperature in its original bag. Do not refrigerate. For later use, freeze the bread in a plastic bag. When ready to consume, remove bread from the bag, allow to thaw and heat in conventional oven at 425 degrees F for 3-5 minutes. Let the bread cool before eating.","warnings":"Allergen Warning: This product was made in a facility that may also process common food allergens including milk, walnuts, pecan nuts, eggs and soybean.","ingredients":"Unbleached Flour (Wheat Flour, Malted Barley Flour), Water, Contains Less than 2% of the Following: Sour Culture, Salt, Yeast, Semolina, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Ferrous Sulfate.","organic":false,"kosher":false,"gluten_free":false,"low_fat":false,"fat_free":false,"sugar_free":false,"vegan":false,"vegetarian":false,"serving_size":"2 oz","servings_per_container":"8","calories":130,"fat_calories":0,"fat":0.0,"saturated_fat":0.0,"trans_fat":0.0,"polyunsaturated_fat":null,"monounsaturated_fat":null,"cholesterol":0,"sodium":330,"potassium":null,"carbohydrate":27,"fiber":1,"sugars":1,"protein":4,"alcohol_by_volume":null},{"id":3991559,"available":true,"unlisted":false,"aisle_id":594,"sale_percent":null,"department_id":91,"brand_name":"Dave's Killer Bread","name":"Bread Dave's Killer Bread Organic Sliced Good Seed Bread","display_name":"Dave's Killer Bread Organic Sliced Good Seed Bread","price":5.99,"full_price":null,"sale_price":null,"price_per_unit":5.99,"loyalty_price":null,"loyalty_price_active":false,"size":"27 oz","display_size":"27 oz","product_type":"normal","unit":"each","par_weight":null,"related_item_ids":[],"visible":true,"warehouse_id":3,"primary_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/primary_762215bc-0bac-40e0-acb8-e1f15481ddcf.jpg","large_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/large_762215bc-0bac-40e0-acb8-e1f15481ddcf.jpg","frequently_not_found":null,"frequently_found":null,"often_out_of_stock":null,"special_instructions":null,"featured":false,"user_description":null,"unit_count":null,"bulky":false,"taxable":false,"is_alcoholic?":false,"impulse_buy":null,"wine_rating":null,"product_id":48644,"aisle_ids":[594],"department_ids":[91],"aisle_sort_order":16,"aisle_sort_orders":{"594":16},"dept_sort_order":22,"dept_sort_orders":{"91":22},"details":"","directions":null,"warnings":"Manufactured in a facility that uses tree nuts.

Nature's ingredients. Brotzeit (Breadtime). Brotzeit is a word that speaks of the old world respect for bread as a way of life. It is the mid-morning break that people celebrate by sharing freshly baked bread with co-workers, friends, and family. European bread baking is a sophisticated art. Centuries of experience in using only simple, natural ingredients, and allowing time for the bread to rise slowly, is passed from master-bakers to apprentices. The result is a wholesome, full-flavored loaf of bread, worthy of sharing with those we love. I opened Beckmann's Old World Bakery in Santa Cruz in 1985, honoring the German commitment to traditional bread-making. My years as a baker's apprentice in Heidelberg, combined with working in my family's business gave me the tools of my trade. My personal belief in socially responsible work is reflected in providing nutritious goods baked with care, providing a good work environment, and serving our community. It is our highest business priority to maintain quality, consistency, and service to our customers. We value your support and are proud to provide baked goods that enhance your way of life. - Peter Beckmann. No trans fat.

ingredients. 5 g protein & fat free. Brotzeit (Breadtime). Brotzeit is a word that speaks of the old world respect for bread as a way of life. It is the mid-morning break that people celebrate by sharing freshly baked bread with co-workers, friends, and family. European bread baking is a sophisticated art. Centuries of experience in using only simple, natural ingredients, and allowing time for the bread to rise slowly, is passed from master-bakers to apprentices. The result is a wholesome, full-flavored loaf of bread, worthy of sharing with those we love. I opened Beckmann's Old World Bakery in Santa Cruz in 1985, honoring the German commitment to traditional bread-making. My years as a baker's apprentice in Heidelberg, combined with working in my family's business gave me the tools of my trade. My personal belief in socially responsible work is reflected in providing nutritious goods baked with care, providing a good work environment, and serving our community. It is our highest business priority to maintain quality, consistency, and service to our customers. We value your support and are proud to provide baked goods that enhance your way of life. - Peter Beckmann. No trans fat.

Fresh daily. In 1988, our founder Nancy Silverton combined flour and water with organic grapes. These ancient ingredients and their wild yeasts were the beginning of our signature sourdough starter. From it we created our whole wheat and rye starters. These three starters are the foundation of virtually all of the breads we make. Although the elements are basic, producing our bread is not simple. As they are alive, our breads require a daily response to environmental changes and constant fine tuning of our bread making techniques. When you try our breads you will taste the quality and flavors that only this kind of passionate attention to detail can assure.

in a stone bed hearth oven. Celebrating 30 years. 1981-2011. Tradition - Innovation. Always The Freshest Loaf: Bakers of Paris baked this loaf of bread today in the stone ovens of out local bakery and delivered it straight to your market, warm and fresh, just as we've done every day but Christmas Day since 1981. Natural Ingredients: We use all-natural ingredients - unbleached flour, wheat starter, yeast, salt, and water - in the classique French bread making tradition, with no dough conditioner, preservatives, sugar, transfer, or cholesterol allowed. When ready to use, simply thaw for 30 minutes, then place in a preheated 425 degrees F oven for several minutes. For best results, let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Pioneer in Fresh and Traditional French Bread: Bakers of Paris was started in 1981 by two Parisiens who had moved to San Francisco and were homesick for traditional French bread, baked fresh daily. They found that there were no Bay Area bakeries that used classic French baking methods, and none that baked fresh bread daily. After joining with a bread-loving San Franciscan, they set about to change all that. Bakers of Paris pioneered the delivery of fresh bread in the Bay Area seven days a week, including holidays (except Christmas Day). And they have continued ever since to deliver the freshest French bread, using the same method as practiced in Paris, France.","directions":"How to Enjoy your French Bread: To enhance its authentic

These ancient ingredients and their wild yeasts were the beginning of our signature sourdough starter. From it we created our whole wheat and rye starters. These three starters are the foundations for virtually all of the breads we make. Although the elements are basic, producing our bread is not simple. As they are alive, our breads require a daily response to environmental changes and constant fine tuning of our bread making techniques. When you try our breads you will taste the quality and flavors that only this kind of passionate attention to detail can assure. Pecan Raisin Oval: One of our restaurant customers asked us to develop this bread for them. We liked the results so much, we decided to share it with our friends. It has a wonderful nutty flavor with a touch of sweetness from the raisins.

Although the elements are basic, producing our bread in not simple. As they are alive, our breads require a daily response to environmental changes and constant fine tuning of our bread making techniques. When you try our breads you will taste the quality and flavors that only this kind of passionate attention to detail can assure. Rosemary Olive Oil Round: Our most popular specialty bread. We start with our sourdough but add extra virgin olive oil and freshly stripped rosemary which gives the bread a pleasing, soft almost silky texture an distinctive rosemary flavor. The leftover bread makes a great stuffing.","directions":"Our breads taste best on the day of purchase, although they will keep longer. Remember, the larger the loaf, the longer it will keep.

In 1988, our founder Nancy Silverton combined flour and water with organic grapes. These ancient ingredients and their wild yeasts were the beginning of our signature sourdough starter. From it we created our whole wheat and rye starters. These three starters are the foundation of virtually all of the breads we make. Although the elements are basic, producing our bread is not simple. As they are alive, our breads require a daily response to environmental changes and constant fine tuning of our bread making techniques. When you try our breads you will taste the quality and flavors that only this kind of passionate attention to detail can assure. French Baguette: With a thinner crust and soft texture, this baguette is reminiscent of the traditional breads of France. You can enjoy its buttery, faintly sweet flavor any time of day. The perfect companion to a cafe au lait or some savory smoked prosciutto.","directions":"Our breads taste best on the day of purchase, although they will keep longer. Remember, the larger the loaf, the longer it will keep. Keep the bread at room temperature in its original bag. Do not refrigerate. For later use, freeze the bread in a plastic bag.
