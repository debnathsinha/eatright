Nutrition for sustained energy. Made with organic rolled oats & peanuts. Flavor. Clif Bar is named after my father, Clifford, my childhood hero and companion throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains. In 1990, I lived in a garage with my dog, skis, climbing gear, bicycle, and two trumpets. The inspiration to create an energy bar occurred during a daylong, 175-mile ride with my buddy Jay. We'd been gnawing on some other energy bars. Suddenly, despite my hunger, I couldn't take another bite. That's the moment I now call the epiphany. Two years later, after countless hours in Mom's kitchen, Clif Bar became a reality. And the mission to create a better-tasting energy bar was accomplished. Clif Bar has grown since 1990, and still the spirit of adventure that begun on that ride continues to thrive each day. As the company evolves, we face many choices, yet we always do our best to take care of our people, our community, and our environment. - Gary, Founder and Owner of Clif Bar & Company. 1% For the Planet member.

You'll love the abundant goodness of our Trail Mix granola bars - perfect for your workout or on the trail! About the Seal: In 2002 the USDA released its rules governing the use of the word organic on foods. The USDA Organic seal gives consumers a powerful tool for identifying products that are produced, processed and certified to consistent national organic standards. We are proud to have contributed to the development of the national organic standards with the appointment of four team members to the National Organic Standards Board as organic industry representatives. Which Products Can Bear the Seal: Only products that have been certified organic by the USDA and contain at least 95% organic ingredients may bear the USDA Organic seal. About Organic Certification: Independent agencies accredited by the USDA inspect and review all products bearing the USDA Organic seal to verify compliance with organic standards. Plump raisins. Dried cranberries. Peanuts. Rich chocolate. Wholesome rolled oats. Why eat organic? Our organic foods are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Our organic foods contain no artificial flavors or artificial preservatives. Our organic farming methods help protect and nurture the environment.
