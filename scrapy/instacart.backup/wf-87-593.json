Wrapped tea bags. Naturally caffeine free herbal tea. Created by herbalists. Since 1974. USDA organic. Certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). 100% certified organic ingredients. Organic bitter fennel fruit [PhEur]: This is the pharmacopoeial quality standard we use because quality matters. Personality: Pleasant and gentle, a great after dinner companion. Foeniculum vulgare subsp. vulgare var. vulgare. Herbal Power: soothes and supports your digestion. Reason to Love: The ancients of many cultures revered fennel both for its licorice-like aroma and taste, as well as for its charming properties. Attributed with the power to bestow long life, courage, strength and even to ward off evil spirits, we modern plant people highly regard fennel for its capacity to ease uncomfortable feelings of fullness, bloating or gassiness, or as an all-around promoter of healthy digestion. Taste: Sweet and mildly bitter, with a distinct licorice-like taste. Organic Fennel: Some of our favorite organic fennel comes from small farms in Bulgaria - one of fennel's native stomping grounds - where it is harvested in the late summer to early fall. Not to be confused with the sweet fennel that is ubiquitous in food and flavoring, the bitter fennel we use is a different variety that has higher essential oil content, which is what gives you that pleasantly soothing experience. Low heat dried and squeeze cut (a gentle process that preserves quality), you'll notice little droplets of oil on the top of your tea, a sign of extremely high quality. www.traditionalmedicinals.com. We've got the right stuff. We raise the bar. The quality standard of the herbs we use is hard to pronounce, difficult to meet, and it's what makes us different, better. We're not ashamed to say it. Pharmacopoeial: it's the only quality standard our herbalists can rely on when blending teas for your health and wellness.

Supports throat health. New look. Same great tea! Since 1974. Created by herbalists. Kids teas. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. USDA organic. Gigi Giraffe has a long neck. She likes to talk and sing. She has to take special care of her throat! Luckily, she's got Tea-ger the Tiger for a friend. He knows all about special plants and goes to his garden and picks these special herbs to make organic Throat Coat tea. Tea-ger grows herbs like sage and marshmallow root. Marshmallow root has a funny name but it doesn't have a bunch of fluffy, white marshmallows hanging off of it. Tea-ger knows how to make the tea taste good too, so Gigi loves her organic Throat Coat tea. Your child will enjoy the slightly sweet and spicy flavor of organic Throat Coat tea. Brew well to be well! This organic Throat Coat tea is made especially for your child. Children's bodies need special attention and care.

As the mate gourd is passed around the circle, a sense of connection emerges. The first step of the ceremony is the preparation of the gourd. Typically, the cebador/a (mate server) prepares mate for a friend or a group of friends. The cebador/a drinks the first one or two gourd-fulls, testing the water to ensure that only a smooth running mate is shared. Then the gourd is refilled with water and passed counter-clockwise with the bombilla (straw-filter) facing the recipient. Each person drinks the entire gourd: you share the vessel, not the liquid. The recipient of the gourd has as much time as needed to finish the gourd-full. After the last few sips of the mate are gone, the gourd is returned with the bombilla facing the cebador/a. The gourd is refilled with hot water and follows around the circle, continuing in this fashion until the mate is lavado (flat). If someone has had enough mate, they simply say gracias (thank you) to indicate that they are finished. Certified organic by: CCOF. Contains the caffeine equivalent of 3/4 cup of coffee per serving.

Hot Yerba Mate: Brew in a French press, or coffee/espresso maker for 3-10 minutes. We suggest using one tablespoon per cup of water. Adjust to your desired strength. Or, enjoy in a mate gourd. Mate Latte: Brew a strong cup of yerba mate, then add your favorite milk and sweetener to taste. Iced Mate: Brew a cup of hot mate, then add ice. Special Tips: To experience the full health benefits of yerba mate, we recommend drinking 2 cups daily. Never boil mate - first, moisten the mate with cold water to protect the nutrients and flavor, then add hot water. Do not drink mate above 150 degrees fahrenheit. Store your mate in a dry, air tight container or in this package, away from direct heat and light.","warnings":"*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Barely making ends meet, and with no health insurance to cover Sage's mounting medical costs, Zhena was determined to earn the income necessary to support the needs of her son and finance the surgeries needed to ensure Sage's survival. With her degree in aromatherapy, love of tea and a small collection of money from friends and family, Zhena embraced her Ukrainian Gypsy ancestry and began peddling her teas out of a cart on California street corners. Believing that selling her tins of tea could alter fate, Zhena became a purveyor of hope and the founder of Zhena's Gypsy Tea. Today Sage is a healthy, energetic boy and the company is an award-winning brand delighting consumers around the globe.

Barely making ends meet, and with no health insurance to cover Sage's mounting medical costs, Zhena was determined to earn the income necessary to support the needs of her son and finance the surgeries needed to ensure Sage's survival. With her degree in aromatherapy, love of tea and a small collection of money from friends and family, Zhena embraced her Ukrainian Gypsy ancestry and began peddling her teas out of a cart on California street corners. Believing that selling her tins of tea could alter fate, Zhena became a purveyor of hope and the founder of Zhena's Gypsy Tea. Today Sage is a healthy, energetic boy and the company is an award-winning brand delighting consumers around the globe.
