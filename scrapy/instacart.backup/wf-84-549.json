Madhava Natural Sweeteners has been dedicated to bringing you the highest quality all-natural sweeteners on the planet since our humble beginnings back in 1973. Our story begins in a 100-year-old farmhouse on a small, scenic farm in the foothills of Colorado, just outside of Boulder. It was there our founder - with the help of some good friends, local beekeepers, and some very busy bees - started producing and selling delicious, pure honey. We've grown considerably since those early days, but we've stayed close to our roots. In addition to pure honey, we offer all-natural, organic agave; and sustainably grown and harvested coconut sugar. We're proud to bring the highest quality, sustainable sweeteners from the family farm to your family's table. Certified Organic by: Colorado Department of Agriculture. USDA Organic. Gluten free.
