Do not leave sitting out after defrosting. Refrigerate if not using immediately. Shelf life: day defrosted plus one additional day in refrigerator.\nUnwrap pastry and place on floured board or table. Unfold, remove inner papers and dust lightly with flour. Turn over and flour the other side. Depending on your recipe, dough may require rolling out gently before cutting. Cut into desired shapes according to your recipes using a sharp knife or pizza wheel.\nIf recipe requires, after filling, brush pastry with egg wash (whole egg beaten with about 1 tsp. water) and chill and rest in refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nPlace on greased baking pan or pan lined with parchment paper.\nWe have found our puff pastry works best baked at moderate temperatures. We suggest baking in pre-heated 375 degrees oven (or 325 degrees F convection oven) until thoroughly firm and dry to touch. Do not underbake. If product looks nicely browned and puffed when removed from oven and then collapses when cool, it has been underbaked. Either raise temperature and/or bake longer.\nVol-au vents (patty shells): Dough must be twice as thick as this sheet of dough. To achieve that, paint egg wash on top of opened out sheet. Fold in half or place second sheet on top. Cut out desired-size round with a cookie cutter. Within that round, press a slightly smaller cutter halfway through the round to score a rim. Egg wash top. Bake until sides are firm. Cut around scoring mark with a sharp knife reserving lid if desired. With a fork, scrape out unbaked dough in center.\nMock Napoleons: Roll to 11 1/2\" by 20\" long. Cut 16 rectangles 2 3/4\" by 4 3/4\". Egg wash. Chill 30 mins. Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven until firm (20-30 mins) cool. Place filling on one rectangle and top with another to form puffed, flaky sandwich.\nSave scraps. You may cut out decorative shapes (fleurons) to garnish soups or potpie tops. Or ball up remaining scraps and flatten. (Rerolled dough will not rise much, but many products can be made with great success. Save the scraps from each package you use.) Wrap in plastic. Rest in the refrigerator for at least several hours or freeze. Use for piecrusts. Dust with flour and roll out as thin as you can. Let dough shrink back by lifting off surface and gently bouncing up. Fold in half and then in quarters. Lay in pie plate and unfold. Prick with a fork and prepare pie according to your recipe.\nYield from one package: one 9\" pie shell, pot pie or pie top, 26 half-inch palmiers; 18-20 3\" rounds for hors d'oeuvres; 12 circles, each 3 3/4\", for savory or sweet turnovers or individual pot pie tops; five traditional Napoleons cut into 2 3/4\" x 4 3/4\"; 46 straws 7-8\" long.\nRecipe for Savory or Sweet Straws: Yield from one sheet Dufour puff pastry - approximately 46 - 7\" to 8\" straws. Unfold sheet of dough on to lightly floured work surface or use balled up scraps to equal approximately one package. Dust lightly with flour. Roll out to measure 10\" x 30\" and very thin 1/16\". Brush top of dough lightly with water. If savory, generously sprinkle horizontal half of dough with Parmesan cheese and lightly dust with paprika, pepper or other spice or herb. If sweet, instead use generous sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. Fold blank half over sprinkled half to measure 10\" x 15\". After folding, sprinkle additional cheese mixture or sugar on top and very gently go over with rolling pin just to seal layers together. With pizza cutter, trim off folded edge. Cut in half vertically so that you have 2 pieces 5\" x 15\". Cut horizontally into strips 3/4\" x 5\". Twist as lightly as you can. Strip will lengthen. Press ends down to adhere to ungreased sheet pan. This will help keep from shrinking. Space at least 1 1/2\" apart. Rest in refrigerator 30 minutes. Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20-25 minutes until firm. If soft but browned after 15 minutes, turn off oven, prop door slightly ajar and leave inside until dry.","warnings":"Allergens: This product is prepared and packaged in a facility that processes the following allergens: Wheat, Soy, Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Fish, Shellfish, Dairy and Eggs.

When you stick an Italian in the kitchen, it's inevitable that some hazelnuts and chocolate are going to find their way into dessert. Our chef started with nutty Alba hazelnut gelato made with hazelnuts from the Piemonte region of Italy. He then folded in dark chocolate gelato made with 99% cacao and sandwiched it all between two dark chocolate wafers. The result? Italian-inspired amazingness also known as Alba Hazelnut Dark Chocolate gelato squares. No artificial hormones (No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non-rBST-treated cows.). Organic cane sugar. ciaobellagelato.com. In 1983, Ciao Bella Gelato was founded to spread our love of food by creating and sharing our authentic Italian gelato and sorbetto. We believe the very nature of dessert being unnecessary to survival is exactly why it should be as pleasurable as humanly possible. Every flavor of our fabulously rich gelato has been created to satisfy a craving for something decadent and creamy. Our velvety smooth sorbetto is crafted to bring the simple punch of intense flavor found in the very best fruits from around the globe. Together, our gelato and sorbetto are Ciao Bella's signature touch at the end of a memorable meal, the final exclamation point, which showcases all we value.","directions":null,"warnings":"Contains: milk, soy, wheat, hazelnuts.
