Cooking: Seitan is extremely versatile: saute, grill, pan-fry, steam, bake or microwave it. For different textures, try cubing, slicing or grinding it - any way you might use tofu. Seitan absorbs your favorite marinades and spices, so be creative! And since it's already cooked, it only needs re-heating. Because it's low fat and pre-cooked, lightly oil the pan and keep heat medium to low to prevent sticking. Traditional-style strips work well in Asian stir-fries, fajitas, pastas and soups.

protein powder. Nourishing people & planet. USDA organic. Easy mixing. 15 g protein per serving. Just hemp - no additives. Trust Nutiva for the freshest, best-tasting products. Imagine an organic food with 50% protein, 11% fat, 25% fiber (90% insoluble, 10% soluble), magnesium, iron, and zinc. Did you know that hempseed is one of nature's most perfect superfoods? Extremely Nutritious: One serving provides 15 grams of raw organic protein and 8 grams of fiber (32% RDI). Hemp contains all 8 essential amino acids with the bonus of good-for-you essential fatty acids (2 g per serving). Planet-Friendly: Do yourself - and the planet - a favor! Choose certified-organic hemp - the Earth's premier renewable resource. 1% of sales donated to sustainable agriculture. A Great Protein Source: Hemp is an easily digestible, high-quality plant protein with branched-chain amino acids that are vital for good health. Contains no hexane, gluten, dairy, lactose, or sweeteners. Why hemp protein is ideal: It contains 66% edestin (a bioactive globulin protein that's easy to digest) - more than any other plant! No petroleum solvents used: Most non-organic soy proteins are processed with hexane, a harsh solvent similar to gasoline. Certified organic by: Ecocert & QAI.

All natural. No maltitol. No artificial sweeteners. 17 g protein. 3 g sugar. 7 g fiber. Gluten free. Vegan. No maltitol and no artificial sweeteners. Getting slim is now something you and your stomach can both agree on. Certified gluten-free. Contains natural flavanol antioxidants. Getting real when it comes to your health. For years our customers have told us that they wanted a low sugar, high protein snack without the artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols (maltitol) found in so many other diet products. Maltitol, a sugar alcohol, can cause major gastric problems like bloating, stomach pain and cramps and can have an awful aftertaste. At NuGo, we wanted to give our customers a more natural option without sacrificing taste - so we sweetened NuGo Slim with a natural dietary fiber, chicory root. Then, we dipped NuGo Slim in real dark chocolate which only adds 3 g of sugar, but makes all the difference in the world when it comes to the taste. All other low sugar bars use fake chocolate flavored palm oil coatings sweetened with maltitol - can you imagine something like that tasting good? No way. NuGu Slim uses real dark chocolate which melts in your mouth, tastes better and has added health benefits! Real dark chocolate. Real delicious. Without using maltitol - that is the NuGo Slim difference. Product is certified kosher pareve. Fast Facts for Slim: 180 calories, 17 g protein, 3 g sugar, 7 g fiber.
