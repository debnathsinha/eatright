Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official \"rabbit of approval\" representing the simplicity, care and goodness in all of our products.\nMeet Our Bernie-Approved Farmers: Fresh out of college, we combined what little savings we had, bought a herd of 40 Jersey cows and began our lives dairying in the fertile valley of Ferndale, California. Twenty-five years and four children later, we are proud to be farmers for Rumiano Cheese Company, who makes grass-fed cheese for Annie's. Our cows are grass fed, roaming freely throughout our green pastures. We are most proud that our dairy is fully organic certified, which means we don't use any persistent toxic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or GMO's when producing our milk. We love raising healthy cows, which makes for great cheese! Sincerely, Jim + Jacque.\nWe work with trusted suppliers to source only non-GMO ingredients. Whole Grain Stamp: 8g or more per serving.","directions":"Annie's Way in 10 Minutes: 1. Boil 6 cups water in a medium saucepan. 2. Stir in pasta, bring to boil. Cook 8-10 minutes, or until done, stirring occasionally. 3. Drain pasta in colander. While pasta is draining... 4. Add 3 Tbsp. lowfat milk to the warm saucepan. (Optional: Add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter for richer flavor) 5. Sprinkle cheese over milk; stir to combine. 6. Add cooked pasta back to saucepan and stir well. Annie's Suggestions: For a richer flavor, add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter. For a creamy, tangy version, replace milk with 1/2 cup lowfat yogurt.\nKeep in a cool, dry place.","warnings":null,"ingredients":"Organic Wheat Pasta Shells (Organic Wheat, Organic Whole Grain Wheat), Organic Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Non-Animal Enzymes), Organic Whey, Salt, Sodium Phosphate, Organic Annatto Extract for Color.","organic":false,"kosher":false,"gluten_free":false,"low_fat":false,"fat_free":false,"sugar_free":false,"vegan":false,"vegetarian":false,"serving_size":"71 g","servings_per_container":"2.5","calories":260,"fat_calories":35,"fat":3.5,"saturated_fat":1.5,"trans_fat":0.0,"polyunsaturated_fat":null,"monounsaturated_fat":null,"cholesterol":10,"sodium":590,"potassium":null,"carbohydrate":47,"fiber":3,"sugars":5,"protein":10,"alcohol_by_volume":null},{"id":3872103,"available":true,"unlisted":false,"aisle_id":547,"sale_percent":null,"department_id":97,"brand_name":"Lundberg Farms","name":"Instant Foods Lundberg Farms Organic Alfredo Risotto","display_name":"Lundberg Farms Organic Alfredo Risotto","price":3.39,"full_price":null,"sale_price":null,"price_per_unit":3.39,"loyalty_price":null,"loyalty_price_active":false,"size":"5.5 oz","display_size":"5.5 oz","product_type":"normal","unit":"each","par_weight":null,"related_item_ids":[],"visible":true,"warehouse_id":3,"primary_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/primary_a9c5217b-9ca8-4ad3-b28a-824dbb02b14b.JPG","large_image_url":"https://d2lnr5mha7bycj.cloudfront.net/itemimage/image/primary_a9c5217b-9ca8-4ad3-b28a-824dbb02b14b.JPG","frequently_not_found":null,"frequently_found":null,"often_out_of_stock":null,"special_instructions":null,"featured":false,"user_description":null,"unit_count":null,"bulky":false,"taxable":false,"is_alcoholic?":false,"impulse_buy":null,"wine_rating":null,"product_id":24375,"aisle_ids":[547],"department_ids":[97],"aisle_sort_order":22,"aisle_sort_orders":{"547":22},"dept_sort_order":139,"dept_sort_orders":{"97":139},"details":"","directions":"Quick & Easy Preparation: 1.

Goodness of Grass Fed Cheese...humanely raised cows graze on pasture grasses...enhancing the flavor and nutrition of their organic milk...made into organic cheese and...combined with organic pasta...to make your meal wonderfully wholesome & delicious!\nMeet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official \"rabbit of approval\" representing the simplicity, care and goodness in all of our products.\nMeet Our Bernie-Approved Farmers: Fresh out of college, we combined what little savings we had, bought a herd of 40 Jersey cows and began our lives dairying in the fertile valley of Ferndale, California. Twenty-five years and four children later, we are proud to be farmers for Rumiano Cheese Company, who makes grass-fed cheese for Annie's. Our cows are grass fed, roaming freely throughout our green pastures. We are most proud that our dairy is fully organic certified, which means we don't use any persistent toxic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or GMO's when producing our milk. We love raising healthy cows, which makes for great cheese! Sincerely, Jim + Jacque.\nWe work with trusted suppliers to source only non-GMO ingredients. Whole Grain Stamp: 8g or more per serving.","directions":"Annie's Way in 10 Minutes: 1. Boil 6 cups water in a medium saucepan. 2. Stir in pasta, bring to boil. Cook 8-10 minutes, or until done, stirring occasionally. 3. Drain pasta in colander. While pasta is draining... 4. Add 3 Tbsp. lowfat milk to the warm saucepan. (Optional: Add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter for richer flavor) 5. Sprinkle cheese over milk; stir to combine. 6. Add cooked pasta back to saucepan and stir well. Annie's Suggestions: For a richer flavor, add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter. For a creamy, tangy version, replace milk with 1/2 cup lowfat yogurt.\nKeep in a cool, dry place.","warnings":null,"ingredients":"Organic Wheat Shell Pasta, Organic Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured
