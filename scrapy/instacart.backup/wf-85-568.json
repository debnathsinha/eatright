Bite size sandwich cracker packs. USDA organic. Produced without synthetic pesticides. No trans fats or corn syrup. No artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.

They also contain real organic peanut butter, no trans fats, no hydrogenated oils, no corn syrup, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, no preservatives, no cholesterol and are kosher and vegan. Why choose our organic snacks? Because while it's popular now to make products with all natural ingredients, in the 25 years our family has been making snack foods, we've always used them and always will. And with our company, Late July Organic Snacks, we've taken that dedication to a higher level by using organic ingredients. We are independently owned, family operated and all our products are certified USDA organic. www.latejuly.com. Certified organic by Quality Assurance International. While carefree mid-summer days inspired our name, the love of family inspired our ideals. On any given day you can find three generations at work including my father and cofounder, mother, husband, aunt and three year old son, the boy on the front and the biggest fan of our organic mini sandwich crackers. As a mother, I'm constantly in the position where I need to give my son a snack on the go, but I'm not willing to sacrifice the quality of the ingredients for convenience. These mini sandwich crackers were developed with him in mind. Our family hopes you enjoy them. - Nicole & the entire Late July Family.

Rabbit of approval. Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, In June 1974, my family packed our Chevy Malibu and drove from Connecticut to Leon, Mexico. We stayed at a small school where my father taught English during the summer. In an adobe-walled yard behind the school were 40 rabbits - los conejos. At twelve years old, I was ecstatic to be their caretaker. Since that summer, I've had many rabbits, but never dreamed I would have one that is nationally recognized like Bernie. Bye for now, Annie. Yum! And more yum! We partner with people & places we trust: to grow the organic wheat; to make flour for our Extra Cheesy Cheddar Bunnies and to raise the cows; to produce the milk for our cheese; to make your snack wonderfully wholesome & delicious.
