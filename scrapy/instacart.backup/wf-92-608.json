Cooking: Seitan is extremely versatile: saute, grill, pan-fry, steam, bake or microwave it. For different textures, try cubing, slicing or grinding it - any way you might use tofu. Seitan absorbs your favorite marinades and spices, so be creative! And since it's already cooked, it only needs re-heating. Because it's low fat and pre-cooked, lightly oil the pan and keep heat medium to low to prevent sticking. Slices of traditional seitan make excellent grilled paninis or Philly cheese-style sandwiches. Use it in a soba noodle salad, try it on pizza, or make seitan parmesan.
